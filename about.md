VICWON is a new online portfolio of Victoria Wonnacott’s artworks starting from 2013, a pivotal year in her art practice.

Wonnacott’s current direction in painting merges an intimate realism with an abstract edge. The ‘Notes’ paintings serve as still life works, where the yellow notepapers have been manipulated and cast in many roles and forms. Their alluring beauty and curious contexts embody a personal vision that engages the viewer on many levels. In between high realism and abstraction, this work seeks to create an arena of quiet aspirations and compels the viewer to fill in the space between the lines. The yellow papers continue to nourish Wonnacott's playful perspectives on the representation of colour, light and personal experience in her painting.

Works by Wonnacott have been exhibited in Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal, Miami and Oregon, as well as South Korea and can be found in public and private collections, including the Canada Council Art Bank, The Colart Collection, Collection Loto-Québec, and the Foundation la Chapelle historique du Bon-Pasteur.
