The current collection of paintings by Victoria Wonnacott merges an intimate realism with an abstract edge. The ‘Notes’ paintings serve as still life works, where the yellow notepapers have been manipulated and cast in many roles and forms. Their alluring beauty and curious contexts embody a personal vision that engages the viewer on many levels. In between high realism and abstraction, this work seeks to create an arena of quiet aspirations and compels the viewer to fill in the space between the lines. The yellow papers continue to nourish Wonnacott's playful perspectives on the representation of colour, light and personal experience in her painting.


The ‘Notes’ series found inspiration from a performance gallery project and the ‘InBox’, a sealed steel cube with a thin slot, designed for collecting anonymous and private reflections written on classic yellow lined note pads. The artist and many others have contributed notes to the InBox, and there are many more to be written.
