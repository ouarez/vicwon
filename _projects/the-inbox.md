The Inbox was designed for a thematic gallery project called the ‘Elephant in the Room’.

Artists were asked to step out of their comfort zone and to create their work/s on site over a period of 3 days.

My creation time was spent writing intimate and reflective stuff, ramblings, raves, prayers and questions that would never be answered, it didn’t matter. At the end of the residency, I collected the 84 folded note papers that were strewn about and slipped them into the box.

The box cannot be opened, the notes will never be read. This felt like a new beginning. Gallery visitors were then encouraged to write a note for the InBox and many did so with great sincerity.
